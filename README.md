This code combines hierarchical datasets from the Family Resources Survey and the Households Below Average Income dataset for 2012-2015 in order to explore the characteristics of households unable to afford different forms of housing in the UK. It was written for a Shelter research project.

affordability_analysis.R produces the tables and plots published in this report on households who are unlikely to be able to afford subsidised ownership products http://england.shelter.org.uk/professional_resources/policy_and_research/policy_library/policy_library_folder/research_who_do_ownership_products_risk_leaving_behind

rent_affordability.R produces similar tables and plots for households who can be classed as 'struggling' with their current housing costs

Other scripts can be used as helper functions to both create and analyse a combined dataset of FRS and HBAI SPSS files. These are available from https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/ (registration required)

Please let me know if you use this code.
Feedback and questions welcome.
